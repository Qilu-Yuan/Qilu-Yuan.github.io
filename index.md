# About Me

<img src="https://qilu-yuan.github.io/qiluyuan.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Qilu Yuan (袁琦璐)**.<br>

I am a PhD student in the School of Applied Chemistry and Engineering at [University of Science and Technology of China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I major in Polymer Physics. I am also a PhD student in [Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry](http://www.ciac.jl.cn/) of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by [Prof. WenSheng Xu](http://glass-ciac.com/). I received my B.S. degree in Polymer Materials and Engineering from [Ocean University of China](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/) in 2021.

I am interested in the field of computational simulations of glass formation for polymers and soft matter , as well as polymer glass formation informatics. If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - [yuanql [at] ciac.ac.cn](mailto:yuanql@ciac.ac.cn) or [qiluyuan [at] foxmail.com](mailto:qiluyuan@foxmail.com).

## Research Interests

- Polymer Glass Formation
- Molecular Dynamics Simulation
- Machine Learning Glassy Dynamics

My current research focuses on polymer physics glass formation and dynamics. My interests are on the Molecular Dynamics simulation of polymer glass formation and dynamics, and the development of machine learning methods to understand and predict the glassy dynamics of polymer systems. I am also interested in the application of machine learning to other areas of material science.
